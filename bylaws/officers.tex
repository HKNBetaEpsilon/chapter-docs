\section{Positions and Duties}
The specific officer positions and their duties shall be those enumerated in Appendix~\ref{app:officers}. In addition to the specific duties listed therein for each office, each officer must perform any additional duties assigned by the President.

\section{Vacancy}
Any vacancy in the offices of the chapter shall be filled by a special election at the first regular meeting after the vacancy occurs, and, when possible, before the vacancy occurs. This special election shall follow the same procedure as regular elections. Should the office of President be vacated, the Vice President shall immediately assume the position of President, and the society must vote to fill the office of the Vice President.

\section{Summer}
Some chapter business must be conducted during the break between Winter and Fall semesters. The outgoing and incoming presidents must collectively appoint an acting treasurer if, in their assessment, neither the incoming nor the outgoing treasurer will be able to come to campus with sufficient frequency during the summer. This acting treasurer should be a former treasurer, or, in the absence of all former treasurers, a former officer. This acting treasurer must be added to all accounts and given access to all records in the manner typical of a newly elected treasurer.
