\section{Initiation Fee}
The total fee assessed at the time of initiation shall be the sum of the national fee, as prescribed  by \hkn, and the local induction fee of \$65.

\section{Financial Hardship}
Any candidate for initiation who is unable to pay the initiation fee can petition the Officer Corps for a fee deferral or a fee waiver, which must be approved by a majority vote of present-and-voting members of Officer Corps. The treasurer shall be instructed to pay national fees from chapter funds. If fees are deferred, the candidate in question must pay the treasurer the full amount of the initiation fees (without interest) at some convenient time before the earlier of the end of the following Fall or Winter semester or his/her graduation.
